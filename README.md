### Getting Started

Use pnpm to install dependencies.

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open the link from your terminal to view the app.

### Guidelines

Custom button components are kept at the CSS level. Non-tailwind classes are prefixed with the `c-` prefix, i.e., `c-small` and so on.

If possible, keep a custom component style to tailwind classes, if not move to a custom class, and only at last, create a react component.

### Resources

- Read the [roadmap]() to understand and discuss the journey ahead.
